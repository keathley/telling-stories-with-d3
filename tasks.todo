Premise:
  Data visualizations are tell stories.  However we can't know what those
  stories are until we've started looking at the data.  That means that
  we have to learn how to itterate on our designs quickly if we want to
  deliver meaningful content.  We have to learn how to ask questions with our
  visuals.  I want to show people how to do that.  Teach them how to ask the
  right questions and how to craft designs around that.
